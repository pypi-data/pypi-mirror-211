## Project using

### Startup

```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from authx import Authentication, User, RedisBackend

app = FastAPI()
# Set up Authentication & Authorization
auth = Authentication()

# Set up Pre-configured Routes
app.include_router(auth.auth_router, prefix="/api/users")
app.include_router(auth.social_router, prefix="/auth")
app.include_router(auth.password_router, prefix="/api/users")
app.include_router(auth.admin_router, prefix="/api/users")
app.include_router(auth.search_router, prefix="/api/users")

# Set Redis Cache
auth.set_cache(RedisBackend)
```

### Dependency injections

```py
# Set Anonymous User
@app.get("/anonym")
def anonym_test(user: User = Depends(auth.get_user)):
    pass


# Set Authenticated User
@app.get("/user")
def user_test(user: User = Depends(auth.get_authenticated_user)):
    pass


# Set Admin User (Only for Admins)
@app.get("/admin", dependencies=[Depends(auth.admin_required)])
def admin_test():
    pass
```

### Dependency injections only

```python
from authx import authx, RedisBackend

auth = authx()

auth.set_cache(RedisBackend)
```
