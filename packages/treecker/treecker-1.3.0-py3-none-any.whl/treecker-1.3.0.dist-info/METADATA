## Background

Have you ever wondered if you had accidentally destroyed or altered a part of the data contained in your favorite directory without realizing it?
Do you want to be able to stamp a part of your data and to control at any time that they are still in the state where you had left them?
Do you think that one of your files has been corrupted, but you don't know which one?
If so, this package is for you.

## Features

This Python package is for inspecting and tracking the organization of files in a directory.
A snapshot of the tree structure is saved in a file placed at the root of the tracked directory.
At any time it is possible to compare the current state of the directory with the latest snapshot, and to save the new state.
The program can also check that the file and folder names match a regular expression.
This allows to detect errors in the naming of files.
These features are accessible via the following commands:

* `init`: To create the first snapshot of a directory.
* `status`: To display the changes since last snapshot.
* `commit`: To save the change in a new snapshot.
* `issues`: To display misnamed or unreadable files.
