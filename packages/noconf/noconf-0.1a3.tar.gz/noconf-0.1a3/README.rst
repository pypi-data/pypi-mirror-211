noconf

Key features
============

1. **Flexible configuration**: noconf allows you to configure your
   Python applications using configuration files that use Python
   syntax.

2. **Multiple configuration files**: noconf allows you to split your
   configuration across multiple files, making it easier to manage and
   update your configuration as your application grows.

3. **Configuration referencing**: noconf allows you to reference other
   parts of your configuration from within your configuration,
   avoiding duplication and keeping your configuration DRY (Don't
   Repeat Yourself).

4. **Component-based programming**: noconf enables you to initialize
   classes using your configuration, making it easy to compose complex
   systems out of smaller, reusable components. This promotes code
   reuse and maintainability.
