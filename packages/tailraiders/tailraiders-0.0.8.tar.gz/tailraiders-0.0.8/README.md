# Tailraiders
Tailraiders is a package currently **under development**. It is meant to be used for school and potentially later for Data Science. Modeled after the Tailraiders Alliance Factions, all subpackages are named after those.

## Installation
You can install the package by using the following code:
```
pip install tailraiders
```

## New additions: Version 0.0.8
- Nan now has a function renamed: df_from_file is now use_file
- tailraiders.protector has the class Outliers, for checking skewness and dealing w outliers using IQR
- All files now follow pep8 accordingly
