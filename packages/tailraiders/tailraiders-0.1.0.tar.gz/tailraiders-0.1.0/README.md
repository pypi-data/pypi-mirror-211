# Tailraiders
Tailraiders is a package currently still **under development**. It is meant to be used for school and potentially later for Data Science. Modeled after the Tailraiders Alliance Factions, all subpackages are named after those.

## Installation
You can install the package by using the following code:
```
pip install tailraiders
```

## New additions: Version 0.1.0
- Errors and prints are now displayed properly when running the code
- First more major release, due to this being a now fullfilled assignment
