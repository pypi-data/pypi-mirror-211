# Tailraiders
Tailraiders is a package currently **under development**. It is meant to be used for school and potentially later for Data Science. Modeled after the Tailraiders Alliance Factions, all subpackages are named after those.

## Installation
You can install the package by using the following code:
```
pip install tailraiders
```

## New additions: Version 0.0.9
- Docstrings are fully updated, also the classes now have docstrings
- The __init__ from MeltPlot has been removed due to being unnecessary
- Added setup.cfg to make the F401 errors in __init__.py files no longer show up
- Currently removed troupers functionality, due to errors
