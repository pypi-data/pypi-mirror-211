Install the SSH server: If you haven't already installed the SSH server, you can do so by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n   ```\n\n2. Configure the SSH server: Once the SSH server is installed, you need to configure it. The configuration file for the SSH server is located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. You can edit this file using a text editor such as nano or vim.\n\n3. Change the default port: By default, the SSH server listens on port 22. It is recommended to change this to a different port for security reasons. You can change the port by editing the `Port` line in the `sshd_config` file.\n\n4. Disable root login: It is not recommended to allow root login via SSH. You can disable root login by setting the `PermitRootLogin` option to `no` in the `sshd_config` file.\n\n5. Enable key-based authentication: Key-based authentication is more secure than password-based authentication. You can enable key-based authentication by setting the `PubkeyAuthentication` option to `yes` in the `sshd_config` file.\n\n6. Restart the SSH server: Once you have made the necessary changes to the `sshd_config` file, you need to restart the SSH server for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n   ```\n   sudo service ssh restart\n   ```\n\nThat's it! Your SSH server is now configured and ready to use."}, {"prompt": "command to show files", "response": "The command to show files in a directory is `ls`."}]
