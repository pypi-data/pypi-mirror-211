# multirotor

Simulation of multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles in python.

This package provides an object-oriented interface for modeling and simulating motors, propellers, and airframe of a UAV. Additionally, an OpenAI gym-compatible environment is provided for Reinforcement Learning experiments.

See the [Detailed Demo](./Detailed%20Demo.ipynb) jupyter notebbok for a walkthrough.

## Installation

Install from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

```bash
pip install multirotor
```

Or, clone repository and install for development. This will allow you to change the code of the package so the changes show up when you `import multirotor` in other projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hazrmard/multirotor.git
cd multirotor
pip install -e .

# to also install dependencies for building package/documentation
pip install -e .[DEV]
```

## Usage

```python

```
