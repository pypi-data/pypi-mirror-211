# Version pins, for use as a constraints file.

# docutils has been going through some turmoil.  Different packages require it,
# but have different pins.  This seems to satisfy them all:
#docutils>=0.17,<0.18

# Setuptools became stricter about version number syntax. But it shouldn't be
# checking the Python version like that, should it?

#setuptools<66.0.0
