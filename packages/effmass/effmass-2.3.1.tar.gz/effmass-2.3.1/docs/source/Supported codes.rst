===============

`effmass` currently supports `VASP`, `FHI-Aims`, `Castep` and `ASE`. In the near future we hope to play nicely with other codes that interface with the ASE bandstructure class, and pymatgen. We especially welcome contributions that will help make `effmass` available to more researchers.
