## OMNISOOT
This is a open-source soot modeling tool for low-dimensional reactors and flames. The soot formation and evolution are described using population balance model framework. This code uses [Cantera](https://pypi.org/project/Cantera/) for evaulating the thermodynamic and transport properties of gas mixture and computing chemical reaction rates from provided reaction mechanisms.
