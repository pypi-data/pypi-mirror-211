**NAME**

::

    nopaths - there are no paths

**SYNOPSIS**

::

    python3 -m nopaths <cmd> [key=val] [key==val]
    python3 -m nopaths [-c] [-d] [-v]

**DESCRIPTION**

``nopaths`` is a python3 bot, it connects to irc and provides a select sets of
commands. It doesn't use os.popen, does no external imports, can be run in client
or daemon mode and has batteries included. 

``nopaths`` is intended to be programmable, it provides object persistence, an
event handler and some basic code to load modules that can provide additional
functionality.

``nopaths`` uses object programming, programming where the methods are seperated
out into functions that use the object as the first argument of that funcion.
This gives base class definitions a clean namespace to inherit from and to load
json data into the object's __dict__. A clean namespace prevents a json loaded
attribute to overwrite any methods.

``nopaths`` stores it's data on disk where objects are time versioned and the
last version saved on disk is served to the user layer. Files are JSON dumps
and paths carry the type in the path name what makes reconstruction from
filename easier then reading type from the object.

``nopaths`` has some functionality builtin, it can take notes, add todo, maintain a
shopping list and display rss feeds.
