Description: **NAME**
        
        ::
        
        
            NOPATHS - there are no paths
        
        
        **SYNOPSIS**
        
        ::
        
        
            nopaths <cmd> [key=val] [key==val]

        **DESCRIPTION**
        
        
        ::
        
        
            NOPATHS is a python3 bot, it connects to irc and provides a select sets of
            commands. It doesn't use os.popen, does no external imports, can be run in client
            or daemon mode and has batteries included. 
        
            NOPATHS is intended to be programmable, it provides object persistence, an
            event handler and some basic code to load modules that can provide additional
            functionality.
        
            NOPATHS uses object programming, programming where the methods are seperated
            out into functions that use the object as the first argument of that funcion.
            This gives base class definitions a clean namespace to inherit from and to load
            json data into the object's __dict__. A clean namespace prevents a json loaded
            attribute to overwrite any methods.
        
            NOPATHS stores it's data on disk where objects are time versioned and the
            last version saved on disk is served to the user layer. Files are JSON dumps
            and paths carry the type in the path name what makes reconstruction from
            filename easier then reading type from the object.
        
            NOPATHS has some functionality builtin, it can take notes, add todo, maintain a
            shopping list and display rss feeds. 
        
            NOPATHS has its roots in "no other options available" e.g. no choices left.
        
            NOPATHS is placed in the Public Domain.
