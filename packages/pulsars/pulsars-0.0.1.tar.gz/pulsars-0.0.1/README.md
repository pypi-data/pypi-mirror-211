# 🧰 Pulsars

**"A Practical Machine Learning System for Applied Research"**

## ☕️ About
**Pulsars** (pronounced "Pulsar") is a **high-level** open source interface, built upon **State Of The Art (SOTA)** python libraries, to help researchers, engineers and curious minds to **practically** use [Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) algorithms in their work.

You can see **Pulsars** as a **toolbox** to **manage** the **cumberstone stuff** wich is generally involved for solving **real world problems** using ML/DL solutions.


## 🐍 Built on the Python ecosystem

We do not want to **reinvent the wheel**, that's why **Pulsars** is built upon **Python ML/DL ecosystem**. It is **batteries included** wich means that the necessary **tooling** is provided: 

- 🔁 Machine Learning Lifecycle ([mlflow](https://mlflow.org/))
- 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms ([scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)...)
- 🕸️ Deep Learning Algorithms ([Keras](https://keras.io/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/))
- 🛠️ Hyperparameters Tuning ([Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html))
- 👓 Experiments Tracking ([MLflow tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html))
- 📈 Results visualization ([Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html))

## ⚠️ Under construction
This library is at the **early developement stage** and is truly **experimental**.
This mean **most** of the features are **missing** and the documentation is still **lacking**.
The project **github** repository will be available soon ! Stay tuned !
After the public release of the github repository, contributions of any kinds (code, documentation, logo, community ...) will be really welcome !😁
