              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# tab2neo- backend classes
High-level Python classes to load, model and reshape tabular data imported into Neo4j database  
IMPORTANT NOTE: tested on **versions 4.3.6 and 4.4.11 of Neo4j**  
python verison: 3.8

## Installation

`pip install tab2neo`

## Modules

DATA LOADERS - modules allowing to read data from various formats and write it to neo4j
- FileDataLoader -  Load data into Neo4j, with support the following input formats: sas7bdat, xpt, rda, xls, xlsx, csv See [details](data_loaders/README.md)   

MODEL APPLIERS
- ModelApplier - Class to restructure data in Neo4j database using Class-Relationship model 
(which as well resides in Neo4j). 
See [details](model_appliers/README.md)

DATA PROVIDERS
- DataProvider - To fetch the data already in the database (in particular, the way the data after the 
transformations with ModelApplier in mode='schema_PROPERTY', or any linked data in Neo4j in mode = 'noschema')
See [details](data_providers/README.md)      

MODEL MANAGERS
- ModelManager - Class to manage metadata nodes (Class-Relationship model)
    
QUERY BUILDERS
- QueryBuilder - Class to support creation of cypher queries to work with data in Neo4j  

## End-to-end data loading and reshaping example

The example code below runs through a use case of data loader, model manager, model applier and data provider.

#### Importing the data 

The call to FileDataLoader in the code below connects to the database using environment variables for your host and log-in credentials. Alternatively you can use the format `FileDataLoader(host="bolt://...",credentials=("username","password"))` to connect. The call to clean_slate() empties the database, and then load_file reads in your data from the specified filepath. See our example data [here](examples/data/Record.csv).

```python
from model_managers import ModelManager
from data_loaders import FileDataLoader
from model_appliers import ModelApplier
from data_providers import DataProvider

fdl = FileDataLoader()
fdl.clean_slate()
fdl.load_file(
    folder='examples/data/', 
    filename='Record.csv'
)
```

Now the data will be populated within your database, but it won't be connected in a meaningful way. We have \`Source Data Column\` nodes containing information about the columns of our data - Study, Subject, Age and Sex, and \`Source Data Row\` nodes containing information of the two rows. The following code creates a trivial model(Classes and Relationships) from the data using ModelManager.

```python
mm = ModelManager()
mm.create_model_from_data()
```
Here we can see we now have class and relationship nodes, illustrating connections between Study, Subject, Age and Sex. The red nodes below indicate relationship nodes, while the blue indicate class nodes.

![modelmanager example](examples/data/modelmanager_example.png)

Now using that class-relationship model we built using ModelManager, we can refactor our data and extract entities of the defined classes into separate nodes. In the code below we use `refactor_all` to do this, and we can see in the image that age values of 40 and 50 have been extracted into their own nodes. 

```python
ma = ModelApplier()
ma.refactor_all()

```

![modelapplier example](examples/data/modelapplier_example.png)

Now we have our data set up, we can call it back in a tabular way using DataProvider. Here we call back the Subject, Record and Age classes. 

*Note: The Record class connects the graph between Subject and Age, and so is required for this call, despite not appearing in the output.*

As we have not specified any relationships, we must set `infer_rels=True`. The argument `return_propname = False` ensures that we see the label name in our output, and `return_nodeid = False` removes the id values generated for each unique node in Neo4j from your output.

```python
dp = DataProvider()
dp.get_data_generic(["Subject","Record","Age"],infer_rels=True,return_propname=False,return_nodeid=False) 
```

```
            Subject  Age 
    0            S001      30
    1            S002      40
```
    

Note: ModelManager as well allows to create addtional schema classes with the following functions, however the content of tab2neo package at this stage does not allow to populate those new classes with derived data. This functionality will become available in later releases.

We can create some additional classes using `create_class` from ModelManager:

```python
mm.create_class([
    {'label': 'Parameter', 'short_label': 'PARAM'}, 
    {'label': 'Analysis Value (C)', 'short_label': 'AVALC'}, 
    {'label': 'Analysis Value', 'short_label': 'AVAL'}, 
    {'label': 'Record', 'short_label': 'RECORD'}
    ])
```
And we can also create related classes, where for each triplet, the required classes and the relationships between them will be created:

```python
mm.create_related_classes_from_list([
    ['Subject', 'Record', 'Record'],
    ['Record', 'Parameter', 'Parameter'],
    ['Record', 'Analysis Value', 'Analysis Value'],
    ['Record', 'Analysis Value (C)', 'Analysis Value (C)'],
]
)
```
And finally we can create Term nodes using `create_ct`. Here the class with label 'Parameter' is being linked with [:HAS_CONTROLLED_TERM] relationships to 'Age' and 'Sex' Term nodes.

```python
mm.create_ct(
    {
    'Parameter': [{'rdfs:label': 'Age'}, {'rdfs:label': 'Sex'}],               
    }
)
```
