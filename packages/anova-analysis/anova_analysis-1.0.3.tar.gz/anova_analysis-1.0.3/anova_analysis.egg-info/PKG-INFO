# ANOVA Analysis Package

The ANOVA Analysis Package is a Python package that provides functions for performing ``Two-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) analysis`` on experimental data.
Currently it can perform RBD analysis only

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```
pip install anova_analysis
```
## Usage

```
from anova_analysis import ANOVA_RBD

#Set the replication, treatment, input_file path and output_file_name

replication = 4
treatment = 23
input_file_path = "data/MODEL_DATA.xlsx"
output_file_name = "test"

# Perform ANOVA analysis

ANOVA_RBD.RBD(replication, treatment, input_file_path, output_file_name )
```
## Features

- Calculates the correction factor, total sum of squares, replication sum of squares, treatment sum of squares, and error sum of squares.
- Generates an ANOVA table with the source, degrees of freedom, sum of squares, mean square, F-values, and p-values at the 5% and 1% significance levels.
- Performs significance testing at the 5% and 1% levels to determine the statistical significance of the factors.
- Saves the ANOVA results in a text file for further analysis or reporting purposes.

## Example Dataset

- The package requires an Excel file containing the experimental data. The data should be arranged in a Randomized Block Design (RBD) format, with treatments (genotypes) in columns and replications in rows. 
- Please ensure that the excel file is in same format as it is given in this [repo](data/MODEL_DATA.xlsx) or below

                | Genotypes | R1    | R2     | R3     | R4     |
                |-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
                | 1x6       | 74.4  | 70.86  | 60.94  | 68     |
                | 1x7       | 91.82 | 99.18  | 118.88 | 120.68 |
                | 1x8       | 48.08 | 62.1   | 58.54  | 41.84  |
                | 2x6       | 59.06 | 65.62  | 81.62  | 86.76  |
                | 2x7       | 84.16 | 109.74 | 102.14 | 94.52  |
- If you have data in the below format, transform it to above said model (individual character) by using this [code](https://github.com/Insight-deviler/Folder-based-Character-Column-Transformation)

        | GENOTYPE | REPLICATION | Days to Maturity | PLANT HEIGHT (cm) |
        |----------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
        | G1       | R1          | 4                | 5                 |
        | G1       | R2          | 5                | 6                 |
        | G1       | R3          | 4                | 9.3               |
        | G2       | R1          | 3                | 9.9               |
        | G2       | R2          | 6                | 7.5               |
