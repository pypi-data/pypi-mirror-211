# psdist

This repository is a collection of analysis and visualization methods for six-dimensional position-momentum space (phase space) distributions. Most of the methods should work for point-cloud or image data of any dimensionality.


## Installation

Each subplot in the figure below shows the measured $x-p_x$ distribution of a hadron beam within a small box in $y-p_y-p_z$ space; $y$ varies along the columns, $p_y$ varies along the rows, and $p_z$ varies with the animation frame number.
