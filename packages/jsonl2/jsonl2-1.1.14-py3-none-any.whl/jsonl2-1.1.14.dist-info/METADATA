# Json Line library

this is a library aiming to handle json line files.

## What is a Json line file (*.jsonl)
A json line file is a text file where each line is a single json document.

The advantages to have a jsonl file are:
1. fast reading, we don't need to wait to read the entire file to know data 
2. skip lines very fast without parsing json documents
3. we can read a jsonl file in parallel

# Installation
``pip install jsonl``

# Usage
```python
from jsonl import Jsonl
#read whole file
data0 = [x for x in Jsonl("/path/to/file")]
#alternative to read 
data1 = list(Jsonl("/path/to/file"))

#read 100 rows after row 20
data2 = [x for x in Jsonl("/path/to/file", offset=20, limit=100)]

#write objects
data3=[{"name":"Newton"}, {"name":"Galileo"}]
Jsonl("/path/to/file","w").write(data3)
```

If the file is located in the cloud, 
you only need to configure your environment
`Jsonl` class will handle it for aws, gcp, etc.

`Jsonl` can handle `.zip` or `.gz` files automatically
you only need to specify the right extension in the path
