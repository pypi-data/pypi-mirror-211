    Since :class:`Segment` is built on top of :class:`Graph`,
    operators and states respect the edge order
    (See :class:`Graph` notes for more details).
    As a consequence, for any vertex :math:`v \in V`,
    the state :math:`\ket{2v - d}` for :math:`d \in \{0, 1\}`
    corresponds to the walker being on vertex :math:`v` and the
    coin pointing rightwars (:math:`d = 0`) or leftwards (:math:`d = 1`).
    For example, the edges labels of the 4-vertices :class:`Segment`
    are represented in Figure 1.
