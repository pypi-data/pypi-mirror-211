# About SSH-Dashboard

SSH-Dashoard is an easy to set-up, basic Linux host monitoring solution which works without the need to install any additional software on the hosts. All host metrics are collected over a non-superuser ssh account.

Host status information are then provided via

 * Websites and/or REST API from an integrated webserver
 * Published to a MQTT broker
 * Written to an InfluxDb server

For more details, see the [documentation](https://s7one.gitlab.io/ssh-dashboard/)
