This library contains functions for analysis of, primarily, data collected from 
electrochemistry experiment. Various functions may be useful beyond the scope of
electrochemistry.

Examples of tools include: baseline subtraction, pairplots, histograms, standard curve creators, smoothing, etc . . . 

The code is developed by researchers at Ekidna Sensing.



Change Log
===========
0.0.5 (May 30, 2023)
-------------------------
- Fifth Release

Notes:
------
Made an adjustment to moving_average_baseline_subtraction function. Previously function would compute an estimate baseline
of an input array and then return the estimated baseline as well as a plot of the input array overlayed with the baseline.
The plotting functionality has been removed such that the only output in the estimated baseline array.
