  masked by small-sized shapes
* At startup, restoring last current panel (image or signal panel)
* Plot cleanup and shape management: greatly optimized performance
* After removing object(s) (signal/image), the previous object in the list is selected
* Added default image visualization settings in .INI configuration file
* Using guiqwt v4.3.2: fixed pixel position (first pixel is centered at (0,0) coords)

## Version 2.1.4 ##

Bug fixes:

* HDF5 import/browser features: added support for non-ASCII dataset names
* ANDOR SIF files:
  * Fixed compatibility issues for various SIF files
  * Fixed unicode error

## Version 2.1.3 ##

Bug fixes:

* Panel's object list `select_rows` method: fixed plot refresh behavior in case of
multiple selection (refresh widget only once)
* LMJ-formatted HDF5 file: now reading invalid compound datasets
* [Issue #16](https://github.com/CODRA-Ingenierie-Informatique/CodraFT/issues/16) - Embedding CodraFT: "add_object" method call with invalid data should lead to app crash
  * Panel's `add_object` method (public API): check data type before adding object to
panel - this prevents CodraFT from crashing when trying to plot invalid data type
afterwards
  * Now handling exceptions in `add_object` and `insert_object` methods
* Multigaussian curve fitting: fixed default fit parameters
* Improved I/O application test with respect to unsupported filetypes

* [Issue #5](https://github.com/CODRA-Ingenierie-Informatique/CodraFT/issues/5) - ROI dialog box: unable to remove all ROIs and validate
* [Issue #8](https://github.com/CODRA-Ingenierie-Informatique/CodraFT/issues/8) - HDF5 import: unable to easily distinguish datasets with the same name but different path
* Average operation now merges ROI data (i.e. same behavior as sum)
* Fixed multiple regressions with ROI management (adding, removing ROI, ...)

Other changes:

* Optimized load time (especially for images): avoid unnecessary refresh when adding objects
* Added "Remove regions of interest" entry to "Computing" menu (and context menu)
* Signal/image list: added tooltip showing a summary of metadata values (e.g. when
  importing data from HDF5, this shows HDF5 filename and HDF5 dataset path) - Issue #8
* Dependencies hash check: feature is now OS-dependent (+ more explicit messages)
* Slightly improved test coverage

## Version 2.1.1 ##

Changes:

* Image Regions Of Interest (ROI):
  * ROIs are now shown as masks (areas outside ROIs are shaded)
  * Added support for circular ROIs
  * ROIs now take into account pixel size (dx, dy) as well as origin (x0, y0)
* Signal and Image ROIs:
  * New default extract mode: creating as many signals/images as ROIs (each ROI is
    extracted into a single signal/image)
  * The old extract mode (single signal/image output) is still available and may be
    enabled using the new checkbox added in ROI extraction dialog box
* Image visualization:
  * Added "Show contrast panel" option in toolbar and view menu
  * By default, contrast panel is now visible
  * When multiple images are selected, the first image LUT range is applied to all
* "View in a new window": now opens non-modal dialogs, thus allowing to visualize
  multiple signals or images in separate windows
* Added demo mode (from command line, simply run: codraft-demo)
* Command line option --h5 is now a positionnal argument (h5)
* Added command line option -b (or --h5browser) to browse a HDF5 file at startup
* Added command line option --version to show CodraFT version

Bug fixes:

* Image computations now takes into account origin (x0, y0), pixel size (dx, dy) as
  well as regions of interest (related features: centroid, enclosing circle, 2D peak
  detection and contour detection)
* Image ROI definition dialog: maximum rows and columns were erroneously truncated
* Centralized argument parsing in CodraFT exec env object, thus avoiding conflicts

## Version 2.0.3 ##

  an image ROI filled with zeros.

* LMJ-formatted HDF5 file support: fixed truncated units.

## Version 1.4.1 ##

Bug fixes:

  which is not the expected behavior ("utf-8" is the expected
  encoding for ensuring better compatibility).

## Version 1.4.0 ##

New features:

* LMJ-formatted HDF5 file import: added support for axis units and labels.

* New curve style behavior (more readable): unselecting items by default,
  circling over curve colors when selecting multiple curve items.

* Added "Delete all" entry to "Edit" menu: this removes all objects (signals or
  images) from current view.

* Added an option "hide_on_close" to CodraFTMainWindow class constructor
  (default value is False): when set to True, CodraFT main window will simply
  hide when "Close" button is clicked, which is the expected behavior when
  embedding CodraFT in another application.

Bug fixes:

* The memory leak fix in app.py was accidentally commented before commit.

## Version 1.2.1 ##

Bug fixes:

* When quitting CodraFT, objects were not deleted: this was causing a memory
  leak when embedding CodraFT in another Qt window.

* When canceling HDF5 import dialog box after selecting at least one signal or
  image, the progress bar was shown even if no data was being imported.

* When closing HDF5 import dialog box, preview signal/image widgets were not
  deleted, hence causing another memory leak.

## Version 1.2.0 ##

New features:

* Added support for uint32 images (converting to int32 data)

* Added "Z-axis logarithmic scale" feature for image items (check out the new
  entries in standard image toolbar and context menu)

* Added "HDF5 I/O Toolbar" to avoid a frequently reported user confusion
  between HDF5 I/O icons and Signal/Image specific I/O icons (i.e. open and
  save actions)

* Cross-section panels are now configured to show only cross-section curves
  associated to the currently selected image (instead of showing all curves,
  including those associated to hidden images)

* Image subtraction: now handling integer underflow

Bug fixes:

* When "Clean up data view" option was enabled, image histogram was not updated
  properly when changing image selection (histogram was the sum of all images
  histograms).

* Changed default image levels histogram "eliminate outliers" value: .1% instead
  of 2% to avoid display bug for noise background images for example (i.e.
  images with high contrast and very narrow histogram levels)

## Version 1.1.2 ##

Bug fixes:

* When the X/Y Cross Section widget is embedded into a main window other than
  CodraFT's, clicking on the "Process signal" button will send the signal to
  CodraFT's signal panel for further processing, as expected.

## Version 1.1.1 ##

Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug leading to "None" titles when importing signals/images from HDF5
  files created outside CodraFT.

## Version 1.1.0 ##

New features:

* Added new icons.

* Images:

  * Added support for SPIRICON image files (single-frame support only).

Bug fixes:

* Fixed a critical bug when opening HDF5 file (bug from "guidata" package).
  Now guidata is patched inside CodraFT to take into account the unusual/risky
  PyQt patch from Taurus package (PyQt API is set to 2 for QString objects and
  instead of raising an ImportError when importing QString from PyQt4.QtCore,
  QString still exists and is replaced by "str"...).

* Images:

  * Centroid feature: coordinates were mixed up in CodraFT application.

* Signals:

  * Curve fitting (gaussian and lorentzian): fixed amplitude initial value
      for automatic fitting feature
  * FWHM and FW1/e²: fixed amplitude computation for input fit parameters
      and output results

## Version 1.0.0 ##

  in it, as expected. It is now hidden by default.

* Improved curve visual when selected: instead of adding big black squares
  along a selected curve, the curve line is simply broader when selected.
