    In the paper, this is called Cycle-back Regression. There are 3 variants
    of this loss:
    i) regression_mse: MSE of the predicted indices and ground truth indices.
    ii) regression_mse_var: MSE of the predicted indices that takes into account
    the variance of the similarities. This is important when the rate at which
    sequences go through different phases changes a lot. The variance scaling
    allows dynamic weighting of the MSE loss based on the similarities.
    iii) regression_huber: Huber loss between the predicted indices and ground
    truth indices.
    Args:
      logits: Tensor, Pre-softmax similarity scores after cycling back to the
        starting sequence.
      labels: Tensor, One hot labels containing the ground truth. The index where
        the cycle started is 1.
      num_steps: Integer, Number of steps in the sequence embeddings.
      steps: Tensor, step indices/frame indices of the embeddings of the shape
        [N, T] where N is the batch size, T is the number of the timesteps.
      seq_lens: Tensor, Lengths of the sequences from which the sampling was done.
        This can provide additional temporal information to the alignment loss.
      loss_type: String, This specifies the kind of regression loss function.
        Currently supported loss functions: regression_mse, regression_mse_var,
        regression_huber.
      normalize_indices: Boolean, If True, normalizes indices by sequence lengths.
        Useful for ensuring numerical instabilities don't arise as sequence
        indices can be large numbers.
      variance_lambda: Float, Weight of the variance of the similarity
        predictions while cycling back. If this is high then the low variance
        similarities are preferred by the loss while making this term low results
        in high variance of the similarities (more uniform/random matching).

       loss: Tensor, A scalar loss calculated using a variant of regression.
