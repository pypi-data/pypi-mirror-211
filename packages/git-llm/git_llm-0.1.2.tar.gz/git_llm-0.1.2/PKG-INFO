## git-llm

The project integrates Git with a llm (OpenAI, LlamaCpp, and GPT-4-All) to extend the capabilities of git. It supports
offline processing using [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) without sharing your code with third parties, or
you can use OpenAI if privacy is not a concern for you. It is only recommended for educational purposes and not for
production use.

### Installation

To install `git-llm`, you need to have Python 3.9 and an OpenAI API
key [api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Additionally, if you want to use the GPT4All model, you
need to download the [ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin) model.
If you prefer a different model, you can download it from [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io) and configure path to it in the
configuration and specify its path in the configuration. If you want some files to be ignored, add them to .gitignore.

To install `git-llm`, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install git-llm
```

### Usage

To use `git-llm`, you need to configure it first. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
git-llm config
```

`changelog` - generates a list of changes from output `git diff --staged`

```bash
git-llm changelog
```

This command reviews the changes staged for commit using `git diff --staged` and writes a commit message following the
Conventional format.

```bash
git-llm commit
```

You can also edit the configuration manually by editing the `~/.git_llm_config.yaml` file. If for some reason you cannot
find the configuration file, just run the tool and at the very beginning it will output the path to the configuration
file.

```yaml
# The OpenAI API key. You can get it from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
api_key: sk-xxx
# maximum size of a chunk of text to be sent to the model
chunk_size: 500
# the maximum tokens
max_tokens: 1048
# model name for the OpenAI API
model_name: gpt-3.5-turbo
# model path for the local model
model_path: models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin
# model type: openai or local
model_type: openai
```

### Features

More commands will be added in the future.
