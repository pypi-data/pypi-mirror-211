description = "lazy-learn is a high-level Python interface for automated machine learning (AutoML) for the lazy data scientist. While there are many AutoML libraries available each typically solves a niche area of the overall ML pipeline without providing a covering and approachable end-to-end system. lazy-learn aims at providing the most approachable and fastest access to building baseline models."
