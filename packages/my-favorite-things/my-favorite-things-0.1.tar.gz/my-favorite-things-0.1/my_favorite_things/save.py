    Saves data to a file. If saving numpy arrays, use `stype="npz"`, to save as a .npz
    file. For other objects such as dicts, use `stype="pkl"` to pickle it.

    We start with: Path / `savepath` where Path is the CWD (either absolute or relative)
    and then we go up that path `parents` number of times. E.g. if we have
    savepath=one/two/three and parents=2 -- we are in Path/one. Next we tack on
    `savedir` and save to `name`. So if parents=0, then we save the file to
    Path / `savepath` / `savedir` / `name`. Otherwise, `parents` refers to the parent
    directories of `savepath`.

    Parameters:
    name - String representing name of file.
    savepath (default "") - Absolute or relative path to save file in depending on
        value of `absolute`.
    savedir (default "") - Directory to save in. Can be a path. This is added on top of
        `savepath` and after `parents` is applied.  So `parents` moves up the tree and
        `savedir` can move down a different branch.
    stype (default "npz") - File type, can be either "npz" for saving numpy arrays or
        "pkl" for saving anything as a pickle file.
    absolute (default False) - If True, we start in the directory `savepath`, move up it
        `parents` number of times, then append `savedir` to it. If False, we start in
        the directory $CWD/`savepath` and do the same thing.
    parents (default 0) - Which parent directory to save in. If 0, saves in same
        directory as this file. If 1, saves in parent directory. If 2, saves in
        grandparent directory. And so on.
    overwrite (default False) - If a file with the same path and file name exists,
        overwrite it if `overwrite=True`. Otherwise, (if append=True) append `_1` to the
        end of the file. If that is already taken, then append `_2` instead. And so on,
        until a unique number is found.
    append (default True) - If True and overwrite=False, append an int to the file name
        as described above in `overwrite` description. If False, abort. If
        overwrite=True, this keyword does nothing.
    dryrun (default False) - If True, will not save anything but only print out where
        the save will be to.
    files - Kwargs for the python objects to save.
