# Artifact Registry tools for Python 2

This repository contains an alternate [keyring](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring) backend implementation to help with interacting with Python repositories hosted on Artifact Registry.

This is a fork of the original [Google Cloud Platform repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/artifact-registry-python-tools) backported to support Python 2.

It's uploaded to PyPi under the name `keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth-py2`.
