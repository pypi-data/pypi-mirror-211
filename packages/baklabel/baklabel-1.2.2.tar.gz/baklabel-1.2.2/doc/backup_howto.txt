Target Audience
===============

'baklabel' is intended for a system administrator to install and set up to suit the
business owner. The instructions are intended to be more or less understandable by
most users but the detailed sections will require some experience or at least moderate
confidence.

This document describes grandfathered backups. It then explains in overview how to
install the necessary components to make a grandfathered backup system actually work.
Finally, it contains the exact (five line) Python script needed to use baklabel and
two sample Windows batch files which employ xcopy in one and robocopy in the other to
perform the backups.

All Windows systems have xcopy and some also have robocopy. Robocopy is more reliable
for larger backups.

Linux or Mac based systems will require a bash script similar to the batch file. Also,
the examples are based on Windows so drive letters will need to be replaced by network
paths on non-Windows machines.


Grandfathered Backups
=====================

Grandfathered backups mean that today's backup will never overwrite yesterday's backup.

In a small office or home office environment it is often quite economical to use a high
capacity USB connected portable drive as backup media. They are large in the multiple
terabyte range and becoming less expensive.

With more than one portable drive, off-site backup is feasible.

The secret of success is _automatic_ creation and selection of the correct destination
folder for the overnight backup. The Python program which nominates the folder name
for  the date of the backup is baklabel.py

baklabel has a number of sensible defaults so it probably doesn't need tweaking. Eg.,
if the backup kicks off between midnight and 4am it defaults to yesterday's backup
label.

This "how to" assumes you have a very large USB drive F: and a typical backup load of
less than a 24th (4 percent) the size of the drive. Your media should be big enough to
permit expected growth in the load over time. There will be up to 24 copies of the
backup for all the grandfathering including one manual backup.

The following pattern of 23 automatically (default) named folders and one manual folder
would normally be entirely adequate because backups only get overwritten periodically
rather than frequently.

F:\backups\manual   (most recent manually initiated backup)
F:\backups\mon      (most recent Monday backup)
F:\backups\tue      (most recent Tuesday backup)
F:\backups\wed      (most recent Wednesday backup)
F:\backups\thu      (most recent Thursday backup)
F:\backups\fri_1    (most recent 1st Friday of the month backup)
F:\backups\fri_2    (most recent 2nd Friday of the month backup)
F:\backups\fri_3    (most recent 3rd Friday of the month backup)
F:\backups\fri_4    (most recent 4th Friday of the month backup)
F:\backups\fri_5    (most recent 5th Friday of the month backup)
F:\backups\sat      (most recent Saturday backup)
F:\backups\sun      (most recent Sunday backup)
F:\backups\jan      (most recent 31 January backup)
F:\backups\feb      (most recent 28 (or 29) February backup)
F:\backups\mar      (most recent 31 March backup)
F:\backups\apr      (most recent 30 April backup)
F:\backups\may      (most recent 31 May backup)
F:\backups\jun      (most recent 30 June backup)
F:\backups\jul      (most recent 31 July backup)
F:\backups\aug      (most recent 31 August backup)
F:\backups\sep      (most recent 30 September backup)
F:\backups\oct      (most recent 31 October backup)
F:\backups\nov      (most recent 30 October backup)
F:\backups\dec_2023 (31 December 2023 backup)


How to set up Grandfathered backups
===================================

- Install Python (see below) and baklabel

- Write a tiny Python program (actually copy/paste) to call backup.bat

- Write and test backup.bat (actually copy/paste and adjust) to copy files

- Schedule the backup to run each day (or night)


Preparations
============

Create an admin folder
----------------------
You need a folder set aside for managing backups. Let's assume you create C:\admin for
this purpose.

Put scripts into the admin folder
---------------------------------
This admin folder will contain scripts and eventually all the log files written during
both scheduled and manual backups. Log files will be named after the bove directory
names eg., log-wed.txt, log-manual.txt etc.

Install Python
--------------
If you don't already have Python on your machine, download and install it from
http://www.python.org.

Install baklabel
----------------
pip install baklabel

Install a large portable disk drive
-----------------------------------
Install a very large removable USB connected drive (eg drive F:) and, staying with the
example above, create a root folder for the backups eg., F:\backups

Your system administrator can postpone acquistion of the portable disk drive pending
calculation of the size required. Do this by using a network or local drive, performing
a manual backup and noting the disk space it occupies.


backup.py - Python script
=========================

Create a new C:\admin\backup.py file using Notepad (not Word) then copy and paste
the following lines:

Note that lines beginning with a # symbol are comments as is everything between pairs of triple-quotes.

## Start copying from here ############################# Notes
import baklabel                                         # 1

baklab = baklabel.Grandad()                             # 2

baklabcmd = f'{backup.bat} {baklab.label()}'            # 3

import os                                               # 4

os.system(baklabcmd)                                    # 5

"""
1. import baklabel imports the baklabel module installed earlier and gives this
backup.py script direct access to the python code which calculates the correct backup
label.

2. baklab = baklabel.Grandad() is python code which creates an object called baklab
(it could be called anything) having all the capabilities set up in the Grandad()
class inside the baklabel module installed earlier.

3. baklabcmd = <some hieroglyphics> is just creating a command line to run the backup.
The curly brackets content get replaced with 'backup.bat' and whatever the label()
method of baklab delivers - let's say 'mon' if today is Monday (after 4am of course).
Then baklabcmd will become "backup.bat mon". See backup.bat below.

Note that scripts are assumed to be in the same C:\admin folder. If not you need to at
least include the full path to backup.bat.

4. import os is python code which imports the os module. This is part of Python which
figures out which operating system you are running (eg., Windows, Mac, Linux etc) so
that the next line works properly.

5. os.system(baklabcmd) is just like typing "backup.bat mon" at a command prompt. It
calls the operating system to execute the command.

"""
## finish copy here #############################


Create your preferred backup.bat
================================
Here are two simple examples. One is for xcopy and the other uses robocopy. Both are
designed to produce the same results. robocopy has sophisticated options to control
logging and here, we choose to report only the directories copied. For xcopy, the
logging is handled manually.

Copy and paste whichever example you prefer into a separate batch file. The name of the
batch file is assumed to be backup.bat in the above Python script so if you choose a
different name make sure you update the Python script accordingly.

Both examples are repeated at the end of this document with all the rem lines stripped
out to provide a cleaner view.

Execute either batch file at any time manually without any parameters to obtain a
backup in the F:\backups\manual folder. Otherwise schedule it to run as described in
Preparations above to get backups in (for example) F:\backups\mon and of course other
baklabel'd directories.

Schedule the nightly backup
===========================
Schedule the backup to run once daily some time after all activity ceases and in time
to complete before the next day's activity commences. Perhaps 1 or 2 in the morning.
As indicated above, if it starts before 4am it will automatically produce the correct
label for the previous day. This is the command line to schedule ...

C:\admin\backup.py

... with a start-in directory of C:\admin




The xcopy and robocopy switches used are typical. See xcopy /? or robocopy /? for more
detail.

Each batch file begins with @echo off and ends with :end.

-------------------------------------
xcopy backup.bat - batch file example
-------------------------------------
@echo off
rem - sample batch file backup.bat for scheduled backups

rem - Using the xcopy options shown in this example, will copy all
rem - specified files (*.* seen below specifies all files) to the
rem - destination backup folder.

rem - Never use xcopy's /a and /m switches. The consequence of doing so is
rem - that your Tuesday backup will be missing files which were xcopy'd
rem - on Monday and so on. It will be difficult to find a file afterwards.
rem - For xcopy option details, enter 'xcopy /?' at a command prompt

rem - cutoff=d:1-1-1980 collects files modified after 1 Jan 1980. This
rem - ought to get all your files. For testing this batch file you could
rem - temporarily choose a very recent date eg., cutoff=d:1-1-2011

set cutoff=d:1-1-1980

rem - If this backup.bat file is executed manually without a parameter
rem - it will default to putting the backup in sub-directory 'manual'.
rem - The baklabel output is otherwise the parameter which is handed
rem - in and will become the sub-dir for the backup

if %1xx==xx (
set subdir=manual

) else (

set subdir=%1
)

rem establish a separate log file for each backup label
set baklog=log-%subdir%.txt

rem - This is the crux of grandfathered backups. dest says it all!
set dest=\backups\%subdir%

rem - In this example we choose to back up only 2 folders. Note that
rem - we don't use drive letters. This is so we can prefix folder names
rem - with the portable drive destination root directories. We use drive
rem - letters to go with the folder names in the actual command lines
rem - below so local network backups can be easily identified in any
rem - complex network backup scenarios.

set folder1=\work
set folder2=\users\mike

rem - collect date and time to write into the log

for %%A in (%Date%) do set Today=%%A
set Now=%Time% on %Today%

rem - Display on-screen a progress message and also log it.

echo --- starting subdir=%subdir% cutoff=%cutoff% --- %Now% ---
echo --- starting subdir=%subdir% cutoff=%cutoff% --- %Now% --- >> %baklog%
echo --- creating directories on F: ---
echo --- creating directories on F: --- >> %baklog%

mkdir F:%dest%%folder1% 2>> %baklog%
mkdir F:%dest%%folder2% 2>> %baklog%

rem - Notice the "echo xcopy ..." line ahead of each xcopy line. This puts
rem - the line into the log. We could achieve this automatically by not
rem - using @echo off in the first line of the file but then the log file
rem - would become messy and difficult to decipher. Copying and pasting
rem - the actual command line into an echo line isn't too difficult

for %%A in (%Date%) do set Today=%%A
set Now=%Time% on %Today%

echo --- commence %subdir% copying --- %Now% ---
echo --- commence %subdir% copying --- %Now% --- >>%baklog%

echo xcopy C:%folder1%\*.* F:%dest%\%folder1% /%cutoff% /e /c /i /q /g /r /k /y /z >> %baklog%
xcopy C:%folder1%\*.* F:%dest%\%folder1% /%cutoff% /e /c /i /q /g /r /k /y /z 2>> %baklog%

echo xcopy C:%folder2%\*.* F:%dest%\%folder2% /%cutoff% /e /c /i /q /g /r /k /y /z >> %baklog%
xcopy C:%folder2%\*.* F:%dest%\%folder2% /%cutoff% /e /c /i /q /g /r /k /y /z 2>> %baklog%

rem - Check the date and time again for the log and write it out

for %%A in (%Date%) do set Today=%%A
set Now=%Time% on %Today%

echo --- finishing %subdir% backup --- %Now% --- >> %baklog%
echo --- finishing %subdir% backup --- %Now% ---

rem - Now clean up the environment variables set earlier. If you want
rem - to examine them during testing, try copying them to the log first.
rem - with ... set >> %baklog%

rem - Here would be a good spot to add other commands for example to
rem - launch notepad with the %baklog% file. Note also that it is likely
rem - that after a while, the logs will grow large and need pruning.
rem - notepad %baklog%

robocopy backup.bat - batch file example
----------------------------------------
@echo off
rem - sample batch file backup.bat for scheduled backups

rem - Using the robocopy options shown in this example, will copy all
rem - specified directory contents (omitting listed exceptions) to the
rem - destination backup

rem - Never use robocopy's /A and /M switches. The consequence of doing
rem - so is that your Tuesday backup will be missing files which were
rem - robocopy'd on Monday and so on. It will be difficult to find a
rem - backed-up file afterwards. For brief robocopy option details,
rem - enter 'robocopy /?' at a command prompt

rem - cutdate=19800101 collects files modified after 1 Jan 1980. This
rem - ought to get all your files. For testing this batch file you could
rem - temporarily choose a very recent date eg., cutdate=20110101 or
rem - use the robocopy sensitivity to such a date format to nominate
rem - a number of days - perhaps 30. Robocopy treats numbers greater
rem - than 1900 as dates rather than a number of days.

set cutdate=19800101

rem - If this backup.bat file is executed manually without a parameter
rem - it will default to putting the backup in sub-directory 'manual'.
rem - The baklabel output is otherwise the parameter which is handed
rem - in and will become the sub-dir for the backup

if %1xx==xx (
set subdir=manual

rem - When doing a 'manual' backup the files always go to the same non-
rem - grandfathered place. In that case overwriting the same files each
rem - time makes little sense - just get new files. Here, cutoff=/M is
rem - an exception to "Never use .." which proves the rule! In fact a
rem - 'manual' backup always goes to the same place which is why it is OK.

set cutoff=/M /MAXAGE:%cutdate%

rem establish a separate log file for each backup label
set baklog=log-%subdir%.txt

rem - This is the crux of grandfathered backups. dest says it all!
set dest=\backups\%subdir%

rem - robocopy doesn't use *.* to represent all files. Instead it
rem - assumes 'all files in the folder' and looks for flagged options to
rem - to omit named files or named directories. Here we assemble flags
rem - and their options into a single opts flag. Check the robocopy
rem - documentation for detail.

set opts1=/E /W:0 /R:0 /IPG:5 /NP /NC /NFL /NJH /LOG+:%baklog%

rem - there are many files of no interest in a backup to be listed here
set opts2=/XF .* *.*~ *.tmp *.svn *.pyc *.pyo *.chk NTUSER.DAT* *.lock

rem - there are many directories we could exclude here
set opts3=/XD .* Temporary Cookies Temp Tmp
