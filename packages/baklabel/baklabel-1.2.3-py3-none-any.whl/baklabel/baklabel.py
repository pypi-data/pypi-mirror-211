Baklabel is intended for use in automated scripts to deliver a sensible directory path
fragment (or label) each day to construct a grandfathered local backup.

Import baklabel.Grandad to produce today's label fragment.

See test_baklabel.py for examples of how to call Grandad

It is also a stand-alone utility to find the backup label produced for any given date
and set of options.

python3 baklabel.py -h  to see command line usage and options.

Python 3.x (Python 2.7 should also work but is no longer tested)

In the doc directory of the baklabel repo, see release_note.txt for more detail on the
package, examples.txt for baklabel output examples and backup_howto.txt for a sample
backup script for Windows.
"""

longerdesc = """
Properly grandfathered, there needs to be a daily backup to one of 23 separate tapes,
sets of media or local directories on a storage device. This complement is made up of
6 weekday backups, 5 week-end backups, 11 month-end backups plus one for year-end.

23 backups is quite economical for 12 months coverage.

This represents real comfort when retrieving data which has been compromised at some
unknown point in the past.

Version    Who  When/What
=========================

ver 1.2.2   md  1 Jun 2023 - Further clean up documentation

ver 1.2.1   md  30 May 2023 - Clean up documentation

ver 1.2.0   md  29 May 2023 - Improve guessdate() to resolve ambiguous dates

ver 1.1.0   md  23 May 2023 - Change from GPL3 to MIT license, change to pyproject.toml
                and clean up strings using f-strings


ver 1.0.3   md  24 Aug 2012 - Code review and tweaks to test importing to cater for
                in-house python path adjustments

ver 1.0.2   md  8 Mar 2011 - Refactored guessdate() out of __main__ to permit string
                dates as a calling convenience

ver 1.0.1   md  4 Nov 2010 - Minor refactoring and tidying comments

ver 1.0.0   md  3 Nov 2010 - New option to append current year to any month-end label,
                not just end-of-year.

ver 0.2.0   md  27 Oct 2010 - Help now respects defaults which have been adjusted in
                the source code. A new default now permits adjustment of new_year_month
                which sets the end-of-year label to any desired month.

ver 0.1.0b   md 8 Oct 2010 - Added -d numeric option for setting the label to x days
                ago. Eg., -1 = yesterday. Also added a time trigger option in the -d
                switch such that, for example, -d 3am will produce yesterday's label
                if baklabel is called prior to 3am

ver 0.0.0a   md 1 Jul 2010 - first written

Grandfathered Backups
====================={1}
Each of the regular weekday Sat to Thu backups will be overwritten seven days later.
However, if an end-of-month occurs on that weekday the month-end backup will happen
instead and that weekday backup will survive for an extra seven days.

Four of the week-end (default is Friday) backups get overwritten four weeks later. The
fifth Friday backup gets overwritten whenever there are five Fridays in a month.

If end-of-month occurs on a Friday then the month-end backup occurs and that Friday
backup survives for an extra month or so before being overwritten again.

Each month-end backup gets overwritten in the following year unless archived.

Here are all the default labels produced by baklabel for on-site backups:

dec_2023  = 31 Dec 2023
nov       = 30 Nov
oct       = 31 Oct
sep       = 30 Sep
aug       = 31 Aug
jul       = 31 Jul
jun       = 30 Jun
may       = 31 May
apr       = 30 Apr
mar       = 31 Mar
feb       = 28 or 29 Feb
jan       = 31 Jan
mon       = day 0 of the week
tue       = day 1 of the week
wed       = day 2 of the week
thu       = day 3 of the week
fri_1,    = day 4 of the week
 fri_2,   = day 4 of the week
  fri_3,  = day 4 of the week
   fri_4, = day 4 of the week
    fri_5 = day 4 of the week
sat       = day 5 of the week
sun       = day 6 of the week

If a backup name is higher in this list than another then it will be produced instead
of the one below it.

End-of-year is usually special for archiving reasons. Otherwise it is just another
month-end. baklabel defaults to appending the year to the December backup label. This
can be defeated with the '-y False' option.

If the new year begins in July rather than January, for example, use the '-n 7' option.
This makes June 30 the end-of-year backup rather than December 31. The June label would
then be 'jun_2023'.

If you prefer a different day than Friday for these week-end backups there is no
command line option. You need to edit the baklabel code and change WEEKLY_DAY to
represent a different day of the week. Use the Python number of the day-of-week.

To defeat week-end backups altogether and make Friday just another day, make WEEKLY_DAY
greater than or equal to 7. Skipping week-end backups would not be recommended by most
grandfathers!

Usage:
    baklabel.py [Options]

Options:
    Without options, produce today's default label. If the current time is
    prior to {1}am (switchover time) then produce yesterday's label.

    -d (default date is today) Or use eg., '-d 2010/3/30' or '-d 30-3-2010'
       Use / or - as date separators. Date format is guessed. Mth-day-year
       only works if day > 12.

       Use -1 for yesterday's label or -7 for last week's label. Use +2 for
       a label for the day after tomorrow. Any number will be computed.

       To adjust the switchover time use eg.,'-d 6am' or '-d 6pm' etc.

    -s (default is {2}) server name used to prefix the backup label

    -y (default is True) Append year to end-of-year label. Or use '-y False'
       or '-y No'. Anything else means True.

    -m (default is False) Append year to end-of-month label. Or use '-m True'
       or '-m Yes'. Anything else means False.

    -n (default is {3}) Month number commencing the new year. January is 1.

    -e (default is '{4}') end-of-year label only has an effect on new year's
       eve in any year. You may prefer '-e eoy' or '-e end-of-year' if you
       don't want a label like 'dec_2010' or 'dec'.

    -w (default is {5}) Day number of weekly backups. Monday is 0, Sunday is 6

    -h (or -?) shows this help text and the default label for today ...
