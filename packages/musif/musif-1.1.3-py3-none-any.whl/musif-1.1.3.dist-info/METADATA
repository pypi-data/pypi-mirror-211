# musif

Python library for **Music Feature Extraction and Analysis**, developed by [Didone Project](https://didone.eu/). 

For more info, see the documentation website at: https://musif.didone.eu

### Instalation
To install the latest version of musif, just run
`pip install musif`
which will download musif and all its necessary dependencies.

# jSymbolic and music21 features
Currently, musif is able to process and integrate jsymbolic as well as basic music21 features. If jsymbolic features are selected, Java JRE >= 8 must be installed in your OS and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable correctly set. `jSymbolic` will be downloaded automatically at the first run. You can force the download of `jSymbolic` and the check of Java installation by running `python -m musif.extract.features.jsymbolic`.

*Important*: right now jSymbolic features are NOT guaranteed to be compatible with musif's cache system, unlike the other stock features and music21 ones.
