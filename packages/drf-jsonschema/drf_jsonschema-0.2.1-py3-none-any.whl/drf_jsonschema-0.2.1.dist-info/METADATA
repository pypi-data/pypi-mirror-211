=============================
drf-jsonschema
=============================
drf-jsonschema, created by Kiratech from extending `jsonschema <https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema>`_ package.
This package provides JsonSchemaField and constructs JsonSchema validation error into error tree for Django Rest Framework with custom error message. 

This package will install `jsonschema <https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema>`_ automatically so manual installation is not necessary.

Quick Start
-----------

1. You can use JsonSchemaFieldValidator in Django's ``models.py`` as such::

    from drf_jsonschema import JsonSchemaFieldValidator
    ...
    ...
    json_data = models.JSONField(validators=[JsonSchemaFieldValidator(schema=your_json_schema)])

2. On ``serializers.py``, modify the serializer field mapping from ``JSONField`` to ``JSONSchemaField`` as the example below::

    from drf_jsonschema.serializers import JsonSchemaModelSerializer

    class YourSerializer(JsonSchemaModelSerializer):
        ...
