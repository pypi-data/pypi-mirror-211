## What is this?

This is a collection of pre-trained model implementations, which can be used in down-stream packages.

### Goal

The goal of this repository is to make it as easy as possible to try out a pre-trained model, and eventually incorporate it into a new project. To that end, each implementation is a self-contained file, so that you can just copy-paste it wholesale into whatever project your using or use it directly without adding a bunch of dependencies. Additionally, the implementations use high-quality, modern Python syntax to be as easy to follow as possible.
