     Creates a new message and dispatches it to all of the application's endpoints.

    If a message with the same `eventId` already exists for any application in your environment, a 409

    The `eventType` indicates the type and schema of the event. All messages of a certain `eventType`

    Messages can also have `channels`, which similar to event types let endpoints filter by them. Unlike
    event types, messages can have multiple channels, and channels don't imply a specific message
    content or schema.

    The `payload` property is the webhook's body (the actual webhook message). Svix supports payload
