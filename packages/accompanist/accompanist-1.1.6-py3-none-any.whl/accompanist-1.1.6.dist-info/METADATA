# Introduction

## What is Accomapnist?
Accompanist is an AWS WAF log analysis tool.  
It enables you to analyze AWS WAF logs and automatically generate comprehensive analysis reports in just three simple steps. If you're using AWS WAF and CloudWatch Logs, this tool can be helpful for instant log analysis and help you understand the trends of blocked or counted accesses.

- Reporting Items
    - Histgram of requests
        - Total number
        - Number by each provider
    - Top 5 for the following categories:
        - Rule group
        - URI Paths
        - IP addressws
        - Country codes
    - Hit count on specific paths
    - Comment
        - An optional field where you can write additional notes

## Prerequisite

- Target WAF
    - AWS WAFv2
        - Logging: CloudWatch Logs
        - Action: BLOCK or COUNT
    - Third Party WAF (using WebACL)
        - Logging: CloudWatch Logs
        - Action: BLOCK or COUNT

- Requirement of Client Environment
    - IAM Role/User: including permissions to execute as follows
        - (1) `start_query` of Logs Insights
        - (2) `get_query_result` of Logs Insights
        - The example policy is noted the last

# Get Started

## Install

```bash
$ pip install accompanist
```

## Usage

1. First, configure the settings using the following command; this will generate a `config.json` file. 

```bash
$ accompanist init
```

- You must set the log group name using this command, or you can choose to edit the `config.json` file directly.

2. Second, retrieve the query results with the following commnad. 

- For example, to retrieve the `BLOCK` log for the past three days

```bash
$ accompanist listen -a BLOCK -d 3
```

3. Finally, generate a report in PDF format.

```bash
$ accompanist play
```

    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "logs:StartQuery",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:<region>:<aws-acount>:log-group:<log-group-name>:*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "logs:GetQueryResults",
            "Resource": "*"
