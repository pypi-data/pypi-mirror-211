# Simple-ChatGPT-CLI

I believe many others have implemented more sophisticated ChatGPT CLI tools. But this is a super simple one without fancy features that I created with Python for my use case.
My motivation was that using OpenAI API could be much cheaper than subscribing to ChatGPT Plus, and is claimed to be more privacy friendly by some legal experts.

I'm not planning to add fancy features unless I start to feel some feature would be a big plus to my productivity in my use case. But everyone is welcome to use this basic version or fork it to add their features.

## Installation

```bash
pip install simple-chatgpt-cli
```

## Usage

You can run the program with
```bash
chatgpt
```

You must either set/save the key following the CLI prompts (recommended) or set an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Tips

- Use `#multiline` to enter multiline mode. This is useful when you want to enter messages with line breaks.

- Use `#startover` to start a new conversation whenever you switch to a new topic and the bot doesn't need the previous context anymore. This helps reduce your OpenAI bill. The program will remind you of this if you come back to an idle conversation after more than 5 minutes.

## Development

This project was initialized by my [Python project boilerplate](https://github.com/tailaiw/python-boilerplate). So you will need all the prerequisites of that project.
