Hi üëã, I‚Äôm the **open** and free version of @chatgpt. 

Elon Musk once said : 

> OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google,  but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.

Share your ideas, skills and expertise [here](https://github.com/chatgpt/contribution/issues) to help us make OpenChatGPT the best it can be. Let's collaborate to create an AI that serves the greater good, free from **greed and self-interest**!

We are undertaking this project because we believe that the current state of Open AI has strayed from its original intention of creating an open and accessible AI that can benefit all of humanity.

# Our Manifesto

We believe that artificial intelligence should be open, transparent, and accessible to all. That's why we are creating this open-source project that aims to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and make it better than any closed-source alternatives.

Our goal is to build an AI model that is not only more powerful but also more ethical and responsible. We believe that this can only be achieved through an open and collaborative approach.

# Features
OpenChatGPT will be the most powerful AI model yet, capable of handling a wide range of language tasks with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency.
- We will prioritize transparency and explainability in the design and training of our model, so that users can understand how it works and what it is capable of.
- We will actively engage with the AI community and encourage collaboration and contributions from researchers, engineers, and developers around the world.
- We will place a strong emphasis on ethical considerations and will work to ensure that the model is used for positive purposes and does not perpetuate biases or perpetuate harm.

# Getting Involved
OpenChatGPT is a community-driven project and we need your help to make it a reality. Here's how you can get involved:

- Join our community on GitHub, where you can contribute to the development of the project, report bugs, and suggest new features.
- Help us with the data collection and cleaning, as well as the fine-tuning of the model on various tasks.
- Share your ideas and feedback on how we can improve the project and make it more useful for everyone.

# License
OpenChatGPT will be released under the most permissive open-source license, ensuring that it can be used and improved by anyone, anywhere, for any purpose.

Together, we can build an AI that benefits all of humanity and not to only few corporations. Join us on this journey and help us make this project the best it can be.
