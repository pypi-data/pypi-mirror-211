# Mi diferenciaci√≥n 
## This little package proof would help you solve some derivates given a defined function.

Math is not easy, right? You can use some tools to make it easier at least for some calculations. 
This simple package will help you in that.

## Download and install

If you are using `PyPI` installation it's as simple as:

```
pip install midiferenciacion
```

You can also test the unstable version of the package with:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/midiferenciacion
```

## Quick start

First import the midiferenciacion

```
import midiferenciacion

```
Now, you have to be careful with the input of the only function we have for now: derivative. This function gives you the first derivative and you can evaluate the result in two defined points. 

The function derivative receives a function in a string format and (very important) in terms of x variable, and it also receives two values to evaluate the solution.

Here's an example of a single function:

```
midiferenciacion.derivative("x**2", 1, 2)

```

## What's new
