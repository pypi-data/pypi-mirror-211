# Gulag Cleaner

Gulag Cleaner is a tool designed to remove advertisements from PDFs, making it easier to read and navigate documents without being disrupted by unwanted ads.

This tool does not just crop the ads out of the PDF, instead, we extract the original file without ads by manipulating the internal structure of the PDF, ensuring maximum quality.

In addition to removing advertisements, Gulag Cleaner is also capable of extracting metadata, such as the author, subject, university, and more, from the file.

## Installation

To install Gulag Cleaner, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install gulagcleaner
