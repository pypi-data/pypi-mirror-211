NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit for easily adding
    programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational systems.
    Guardrails (or "rails" for short) are specific ways of controlling the output of an LLM,
    e.g., not talking about politics, responding in a particular way to specific user
    requests, following a predefined dialog path, using a particular language style,
    extracting structured data, etc.

    Key Benefits: 
    
    - Building Trustworthy, Safe and Secure LLM Conversational Systems: The core value of
    using NeMo Guardrails is the ability to write fuzzy rails to steer select conversations.
    Developers can choose to define the behavior of their LLM-powered bots on certain
    topics and keep their creativity un-encumbered for others!

    - Connect models, chains, services, and more via actions: LLMs don't need to solve
    all the challenges. NeMo Guardrails provides the ability to connect your codebase or
    services to your chatbot seamlessly and securely!
