"""
The track recover is a plugin that aims to recover track_ids that are lost. A track is considered as lost when
a new one have been generated for an element that already had a track_id associated, loosing the old track_id.
NOTE: This plugin only work in a very limited set of cases. It is only expected to work for very static scenes,
where the elements do not move much and don't overlap one another.
