        Initialize the StateBuffer. It is used for tracking the history of the last scene and
         element states.

        :param buffer_size: int. The size of the history buffer to keep.
        :param running_online: bool. If True, it will assume that the video is comming from an online stream
                like a webcam. So the timestamps of the states will update with the current time in every call.
                If False, it will assume that the video is coming from a pre-recorded file. So the timestamps
                will have to be served from the video.
        :param scene_state_class: type. The class of the scene state. It should be a subclass of SceneState.
        :param element_state_class: Class. The class of the element states. It should be a subclass of ElementState.
        :param finite_state_machines_config: dict. The configuration of the finite state machines for the elements.
                It is a dictionary with the track_id as key and the configuration as value.
        :param keep_elements_history: bool. If True, the element states will be kept in the buffer. If False, the
                element states will be removed from the buffer when they are not in the scene anymore.
        :param recover_tracks_for_static_elements: bool. Only used when finite_state_machines_config is passed.
                If True, it will try to recover the tracks for the elements with a class that fallbacks in a default
                state machine. NOTE: It should ONLY be used when we are expecting very STATIC elements that do not tend
                to overlap with each other. Otherwise, it could produce unexpected results. The expected scenario for
                this flag is when we do expect static elements, that can be partially lost by occlusions, and that have
                an attached state machine that makes transitions based in the object class but that only accept a few
                 entry classes but the classes. For example: A lot of robotic faces that always starts with the class
                 "neutral expression" and for which we are registering the expression transitions.
        :param recover_track_attempts: int. Only used when finite_state_machines_config is passed and
                recover_tracks_for_static_elements is True. The number of attempts to recover the track of the elements
                that fallback in a default state machine.
