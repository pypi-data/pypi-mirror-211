# GitConnect

GitConnect is a Python library that provides an interface for interacting with the GitHub API. It allows you to easily search for repositories by user and keyword, get details about a specific repository, and more.

## Installation
To install GitConnect, simply run:
    
        pip install gitconnect

## Usage
First, you'll need a personal access token for the GitHub API. You can create one by following these steps:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click "Generate new token".
2. Give your token a name and select the scopes that it needs.
3. Click "Generate token" and copy the token value.

Next, create a GitWrapper object with your access token:
```python
from gitconnect import GitWrapper

access_token = 'your_access_token_here'

wrapper = GitWrapper(access_token)
```

Now, you can use the GitWrapper methods to interact with the GitHub API.

## Example 1: Search for repositories by user and keyword
```python
from gitconnect import GitWrapper

access_token = "place_your_github_token_here"
wrapper = GitWrapper(access_token)
user_name ="place_the_git_user_name_here"
repos = wrapper.search_repos_by_user(user_name, "language:py")
print(repos)
```
