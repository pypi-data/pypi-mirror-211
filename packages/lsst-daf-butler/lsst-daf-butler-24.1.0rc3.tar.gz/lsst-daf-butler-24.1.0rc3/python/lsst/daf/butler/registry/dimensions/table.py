    materialized overlaps with skypix dimensions.

    New instances should be constructed by calling `initialize`, not by calling
    the constructor directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    db : `Database`
        Interface to the underlying database engine and namespace.
    element : `DatabaseDimensionElement`
        Dimension element whose overlaps are to be managed.
    summaryTable : `sqlalchemy.schema.Table`
        Table that records which combinations of skypix dimensions and
        governor dimension values have materialized overlap rows.
    overlapTable : `sqlalchemy.schema.Table`
        Table containing the actual materialized overlap rows.
    governor : `GovernorDimensionRecordStorage`
        Record storage backend for this element's governor dimension.

    Notes
    -----
    This class (and most importantly, the tables it relies on) can in principle
    manage overlaps between with any skypix dimension, but at present it is
    only being used to manage relationships with the special ``commonSkyPix``
    dimension, because that's all the query system uses.  Eventually, we expect
    to require users to explicitly materialize all relationships they will
    want to use in queries.

    Other possible future improvements include:

     - allowing finer-grained skypix dimensions to provide overlap rows for
       coarser ones, by dividing indices by powers of 4 (and possibly doing
       ``SELECT DISTINCT`` in the subquery to remove duplicates);

     - allowing finer-grained database elements (e.g. patch) to provide overlap
       rows for coarser ones (e.g. tract), by ignoring irrelevant columns
       (e.g. the patch IDs) in the subquery (again, possible with
       ``SELECT DISTINCT``).

    But there's no point to doing any of that until the query system can
    figure out how best to ask for overlap rows when an exact match isn't
    available.

        If there are existing rows for the given ``governorValue``, overlap
        rows for them will be immediately computed and inserted.  At present,
        that never happens, because we only enable overlaps with
        `DimensionUniverse.commonSkyPix`, and that happens immediately after
        each governor row is inserted (and there can't be any patch rows,
        for example, until after the corresponding skymap row is inserted).

        After calling `enable` for a particular combination, any new records
        for ``self.element`` that are inserted will automatically be
        accompanied by overlap records (via calls to `insert` made
        by `TableDimensionRecordStorage` methods).
