    '''Filters HTML using xpaths.

    :param html: HTML document. It can be either the path to an HTML file, the
    literal document as string or a :class:`lxml.html.HtmlElement` instance.
    :type html: str or :class:`lxml.html.HtmlElement`
    :param xpaths: Mappings from named html elements to their xpath locations.
    Argument can be either a dictionary or the path to a yml file.

    .. note::

        Each mapping is a key-value pair where the key is the name of the html
        element and the value is the element's definition, including the
        following attributes:

        - "xpath": the element's xpath location
        - "matches": either "first" to return only first match or "all" to
        return all of them. Defaults to "first"
        - "elements": optional recursive attribute to map inner elements.

    Example::

        article:
            xpath: //div[@class = "article"]
            matches: first
            elements:
                title: ./@data-title
                author: ./@data-author
                body:
                    xpath: ./p/text()
                    matches: all

    .. note::
        Optionally, one node can be represented as a simple key-value pair,
        where the value is the xpath location. In this case, "matches" defaults
        to "first" and element has no inner nodes (leaf).

    Example::

        article: //div[@class = "article"]/p/text()

    :type xpaths: dict or str or Path
    :returns: A dictionary of filtered HTML elements.
