# Timor GIS

Timor Leste GIS data as Django models
This initial release uses administrative boundariew from Estrada, tweaked to include Atauro as a separate entity, with pcode which are intended to match existing data from PNDS.

## Environment

This is intended to be compatible with:

- Django 4.1+
- Python 3.10+

```sh
gh repo clone catalpainternational/timor_locations
cd timor_locations
poetry install
```
