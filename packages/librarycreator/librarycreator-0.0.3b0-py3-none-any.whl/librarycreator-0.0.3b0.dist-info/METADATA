LibraryCreator is a Python library that provides a user-friendly way to generate setup files, build wheel files, and upload Python libraries to PyPI (Python Package Index). It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) powered by tkinter, making it easy for developers to create and distribute their Python libraries.

Key Features:
- Generate Setup: Generate a setup.py file for a Python library by providing package details such as name, version, description, author, and author email.
- Build Wheel: Build a wheel file for your Python library, simplifying the distribution and installation process.
- Upload Library: Upload your Python library to PyPI with ease, prompting you for your PyPI credentials and handling the upload process for you.

Installation:
You can install LibraryCreator using pip:
    pip install LibraryCreator

Usage:
Here's an example of how to use LibraryCreator:

    from LibraryCreator import LibraryCreator

    # Create an instance of LibraryCreator
