About MelCtl
============

MelCtl provides a set of APIs to interact with LuxProvide_'s HPC (High

to interact with MelCtl APIs.

The base package (`MelCtl client`_) provides basic plugins
(e.g. authentication). Supplementary packages such as
`melctl_client_plugins_customer` provides extra plugins to interact with
more services from the command line.
